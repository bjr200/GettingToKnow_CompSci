# Title: Demystifying Regular Expressions: Understanding the Power of Regex

Introductory paragraph:

Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are a powerful tool for pattern matching and search operations in web development. They provide a concise and flexible way to define search patterns within strings. As a web development student, it is essential to grasp the fundamentals of regex to efficiently manipulate and extract information from text data. In this tutorial, we will explore the different components of a specific regular expression and break down their functionalities, enabling you to understand how regex works in a step-by-step manner.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will dive into a specific regular expression and explain its components one by one. The regex we will be exploring is `/^([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+)@([A-Za-z0-9.-]+)\.([A-Za-z]{2,})$/`. This regex is used to validate email addresses. We will break down each part of the expression and provide a detailed explanation of its purpose and functionality.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to match positions within the input string. In our regex, we have two anchors:
- `^` - The caret symbol at the beginning signifies the start of the line.
- `$` - The dollar sign at the end signifies the end of the line.

These anchors ensure that the regex matches the entire string from start to end, preventing partial matches.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences a particular pattern should have. In our regex, we use the following quantifiers:
- `+` - The plus sign after `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]` and `[A-Za-z0-9.-]` ensures that one or more characters are matched.

These quantifiers allow for matching one or more alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, percentage signs, plus signs, and hyphens.

### OR Operator

The OR operator allows us to match either of two alternatives. In our regex, we use the OR operator (`|`) in the character class `[A-Za-z]{2,}`. This expression matches two or more consecutive alphabetic characters.

### Character Classes

Character classes allow us to specify a set of characters to match. In our regex, we use the following character classes:
- `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]` - Matches any uppercase or lowercase letter, digit, period, underscore, percentage sign, plus sign, or hyphen.
- `[A-Za-z0-9.-]` - Matches any uppercase or lowercase letter, digit, period, or hyphen.

These character classes define the allowed characters in the username and domain parts of the email address.

### Flags

Flags are used to modify the behavior of a regex pattern. Our regex does not include any flags.
